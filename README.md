# 🧠 MIPS Assembly Practice – Beginner to Intermediate Examples

This repository contains a curated collection of MIPS Assembly programs created for learning and practicing low-level programming concepts. Each program demonstrates fundamental aspects of MIPS architecture and assembly language instructions, with clean structure and inline comments.

## 📚 What’s Inside

Each file showcases one or more of the following:

- ✅ User input/output using syscall
- ➕ Integer and floating-point arithmetic (`add`, `sub`, `mult`, `div`, `add.s`, etc.)
- 🔁 Looping and conditional branching (`beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bgt`, etc.)
- 🧮 Array handling using `.word`, `lw`, and `sw`
- 📐 Manual logic implementations: prime check, factorial, digit sum, average, etc.
- 🔢 Conversion between integer and float types
